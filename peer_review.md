# Peer Review

**Notebook reviewed:**
[Final Project: Regression Analysis (Medical Cost Dataset)](https://github.com/14dstcyr/applied-ml-dstcyr/blob/main/docs/project06/ml_regression_stcyr.ipynb)

## 1. Clarity & Organization
The notebook is well-structured with logical sections. Each section flows naturally one after the other. Each step and action is explained and interpreted. Not only are Deb's explanations well thought out, but she tells a compelling story with the data. She explains why features are of importance, and why things turn out like they do. I find myself thinking about how I can improve my own storytelling and explanations in my own notebooks after reading Deb's work. I am tempted to find and read her other notebooks so that I can better follow her example.

## 2. Feature Selection & Justification
Deb chose all features to train the model. I do wonder if including features that have low correlations with charges could negatively impact the model. It might also be beneficial to explore feature engineering by combining features. That said, Deb's explanations for how features could impact charges make sense. I believe including all features is a good starting place.

## 3. Model Performance & Comparisons
Results were clearly explained. Deb created a table that compared train and test scores on all trained models. She concluded that polynomial regression performed the best based on having the best test scores and its ability to capture complex relationships.

---

## 4. Reflection Quality
Reflections clearly explained Deb's thoughts for why models performed the way they did. Her summary concisely explained her findings, and her Challenges Faced section illustrated obstacles in her process and how they were overcome. The If I Had More Time section gave suggestions for further model development and exploration.

Overall, this was a well-organized and thoughtful machine learning project.
